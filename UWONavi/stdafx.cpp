// stdafx.cpp : Precompiled header file for the project
// This file contains precompiled headers for faster compilation.

// The following are explanations of the code and sections:

// The first line includes the "stdafx.h" header, which is the precompiled header.
// Precompiled headers help improve compilation time by storing already compiled code that doesn't change often.

#include "stdafx.h"

// TODO: You might want to include other headers or files here as needed for your specific project
// For example, if you need standard libraries like iostream, you can include them here.

// Below is a placeholder for some future TODO or planned code changes:
// 'TODO' stands for a reminder to the developer that something still needs to be done in the future.
// It could be to organize or add more code or fix certain parts.

// 'STDAFX.H' is the name of a header file that might be used in the project, but it seems like this is just a placeholder for now.

// The text in the comment after 'TODO' seems to be written in Japanese, and it's likely a reminder to complete some tasks or configurations for the code or project. 
// Specifically, it mentions something about the header and some files to be handled in the future, which doesn't impact the existing functionality.

// At this point, the code doesn't perform any specific tasks, and it is mostly used to prepare the project environment for further coding.
